# üó∫Ô∏è Mobile Robotics ü§ñ

In the realm of robotics, a fundamental distinction arises between stationary and mobile robots. This division encompasses the entire spectrum of mobile robotics, which, in essence, revolves around the exploration and utilization of robots capable of navigating their operational space.

This fundamental concept also gives rise to a range of challenges that must be addressed to develop a proficient and capable robot.

This subject addresses these challenges by imparting knowledge on the design and programming of algorithms that empower robots to navigate their surroundings intelligently and autonomously. These algorithms find applications predominantly in **Service Robots**, regardless of whether the robot operates on land, in the air, or underwater.

**Reactive** and **feedback** control techniques enable mobile robots to exhibit basic autonomous behaviors. Moreover, it is essential for a mobile robot to manage and sometimes construct a representation of its environment (maps) to make movement decisions beyond the instant information gathered by its sensors. Another key aspect to harness the maps effectively is for the robot to **self-localize** within them, estimating its 2D or 3D position.

You might be already familiar with [ROS](https://www.ros.org/), [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org/home)...[^1] However, as a novelty in this subject, an educational platform developed by university staff is used. I think it's worth taking a look at the next page to see what this is about!

[^1]: If you are not, I humbly advise you to start there!
